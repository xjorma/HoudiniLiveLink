# Houdini Live Link
Made a proof of concept of live link between Houdini and multiple devices: Oculus quest, Leap motion, maybe more... Stay tuned ;)
This is only a proof of concept, and probably useless as-is, but I hope it could inspire someone to do amazing things.

It's really easy to use just launch the Houdini project and press play on the timeline, and launch the unity project at the same time.
Don't forget to change the ip adress.
